## Important Note: Installation Warning for Unsigned App

As Captain is currently an unsigned application, you may encounter a warning during the installation
process. This is a standard notification for unsigned apps and does not indicate any security issue
with Captain. Since Captain is open source, you can review the source code to ensure its safety.

If you receive a warning, please follow these steps to proceed with the installation:

1. **Windows Users**:

-   When the warning appears, click on "More info".
-   You'll then see the option to "Run anyway". Click it to proceed with the installation.

2. **Mac Users** (if applicable in the future):

-   Right-click (or Ctrl-click) the downloaded file and select "Open".
-   In the warning dialog that appears, click "Open" to proceed.

Rest assured, the integrity and security of Captain are paramount to us. If you have any concerns or
questions, please feel free to review our source code or contact us directly.

Enjoy the powerful capabilities of Captain, and thank you for your trust and support!
