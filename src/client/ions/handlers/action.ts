/**
 * Processes an action based on the provided vector store response. The function distinguishes between
 * "function" actions, which trigger specific functionalities, and other types of actions, such as opening an app.
 *
 * @param {VectorStoreResponse} response - The response object from the vector store, containing the payload
 * with details about the action to be performed.
 *
 * If the action is of type "function", it sends a message via the `window.ipc.send` method with a key built
 * from the `CAPTAIN_ACTION` ID and includes the entire payload in the message.
 *
 * For other types of actions, it constructs a key using the `APP` ID with an optional ":open" suffix
 * and sends a message with the `appId` and action type, derived from the response payload.
 *
 * This allows for dynamic handling of actions within the application, facilitating communication
 * with different parts of the system or triggering specific operations based on the vector store response.
