 * updates and access to this information, facilitating a smoother user experience and enabling effective
 * caching strategies. This store is only updated when the user explicitly requests new data, ensuring

 * of the user's collection, facilitating easy access to and management of their assets. This store
 * helps in organizing the items based on various criteria such as installation status, usage frequency,
 * or custom tags defined by the user. By providing a detailed and easily navigable inventory, the
 * application enhances user engagement and utility, enabling users to efficiently manage their
 * resources and integrate them into their workflows. The inventory store is a pivotal component
 * in bridging the gap between acquisition (via downloads) and utilization of marketplace items.

 * obfuscation tool, designed to deter direct manual edits or unintended disclosures of the contents,
 * rather than providing a foolproof security measure. It effectively makes the sensitive data less
 * accessible to casual browsing or accidental exposure, ensuring that API keys and similar sensitive
 * information are stored in a manner that reduces the risk of them being compromised through simple
 * file inspection or inadvertent sharing.

 * were successful. By maintaining a dedicated store for these app-specific settings,
 * the application can ensure that it is properly initialized and ready for use,
 * enhancing reliability and user experience.
