/**
 * The DownloadManager class serves as a centralized manager for handling all download-related activities within an application.
 * It is designed to manage a queue of downloads, allowing for operations such as adding to the queue, checking the queue's status,
 * and processing downloads in a controlled manner. This class employs a singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance manages
 * the download operations throughout the application lifecycle, thereby preventing conflicts and ensuring consistency in download management.
 *
 * The DownloadManager encapsulates the complexity of download operations, providing a simple and thread-safe interface for queuing and
 * managing downloads. It supports basic queue operations such as adding items to the queue and checking if an item exists within the queue.
 * Additionally, it implements logic to manage concurrent downloads, adhering to a specified limit of concurrent download operations to
 * avoid overwhelming the system or the network connection.
 *
 * This class utilizes events to communicate the progress and completion of downloads, making it easy to integrate with UI components or
 * other parts of the application that require updates on download status. It leverages the electron-dl library for performing the actual
 * download operations, encapsulating the library's functionality and providing a simplified interface for download tasks.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Singleton access to ensure a single point of download management.
 * - Queue management to add, check, and process download items.
 * - Limitation of concurrent downloads to prevent overloading.
 * - Integration with electron-dl for handling download tasks, including support for progress tracking and cancellation.
 * - Event-driven updates for download progress, completion, and errors, facilitating easy integration with other application components.
 *
 * Usage of this class should be done through the getInstance method to access the singleton instance, ensuring that download operations
 * are centrally managed. The class provides methods to manipulate the download queue, including adding new downloads and querying the queue status.
 * It automatically handles the processing of queued downloads, respecting the maximum concurrent downloads limit and updating the status of each download accordingly.
