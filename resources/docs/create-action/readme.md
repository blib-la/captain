# Create Custom Action

This feature allows you to create a new quick action within the system. You can specify the type of action you want to create, and the system will generate a corresponding markdown action file with the necessary information.

## How to Use

1. Invoke this feature by searching for "Create Custom Action" in the dashboard.
2. Provide a specific command for the action you wish to create, for example, "Generate a random image".
3. The system uses your command to generate a new markdown file structured to execute your requested action.

## Behind the Scenes

When you provide a command, the system performs the following steps:

1. Creates a new markdown file with the appropriate frontmatter based on your input.
2. Adds this new action to the quick menu and dashboard, ready for use.

The newly created action is now a part of your personal dashboard, streamlining your workflow by executing complex tasks with simple commands.
