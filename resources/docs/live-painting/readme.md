# Live Painting Feature

## Description
Our live painting feature combines the joy of freehand drawing with the power of AI, using a turbo model of stable diffusion to interpret and enhance your creations in real-time. Whether you’re sketching simple shapes or intricate designs, the AI collaborates with you to bring your visions to life.

## Main Features

- **Stable Diffusion Turbo Models**: Utilizes cutting-edge models to produce images from 1-60 frames per second, depending on your settings and GPU capabilities.
- **Style Helper**: Choose from predefined styles like Children’s Book, Manga, Fantasy Art, and more to guide the AI in the rendering process.
- **Artistic Guidance**: Provide a text prompt to steer the AI’s interpretation in a particular direction, refining the artistic collaboration.
- **Randomize Option**: Generate random seeds to infuse uniqueness into each AI-rendered image.
- **Color and Brush Customization**: Select your preferred brush size and color to match your drawing needs.
- **Model Selector**: Choose from various models to find the best fit for your artistic style or project requirements.
- **Energy Saving**: The feature includes a start/stop function to manage resource utilization effectively, running the AI only when needed.

## How to Use

1. Click on the 'Start' button to activate the live painting mode.
2. Choose a style from the 'Style Helper' dropdown to set the artistic direction.
3. If desired, enter a text prompt to guide the AI's interpretation.
4. Use the brush tools to draw on the canvas. Select colors and brush sizes to your preference.
5. Hit the 'Randomize' button if you wish to have the AI generate a unique seed for the image.

## Saving Your Work
