# Personalized Dashboard

## Description
Our dashboard acts as a central hub for all your applications, documents, and media. It’s driven by a powerful vector search engine that not only finds your items but also displays them with intuitive widgets. Think of it as your AI-powered file explorer that brings everything you need to the forefront, tailored to your preferences and behavior.

## Features

- **Vector Search Engine**: Delivers search results based on content relevance and user behavior, offering a personalized experience.
- **Dynamic Widgets**: Depending on the search results, the dashboard displays unique widgets such as images, app logos, markdown icons, and more.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Seamlessly connects with the marketplace, suggesting new and interesting apps or tools that align with your preferences.
- **Behavioral Tracking**: Employs local behavioral analysis to recommend and display content, respecting your privacy by keeping this data on your computer.
- **Versatile Display**: Whether it’s your recently used documents, newly installed apps, or potential interests, the dashboard brings them all to your attention.

## Usage

Simply type your query into the dashboard search bar. The vector search will interpret your input and display relevant results across:

- Installed applications and tools
- Your documents and files
- Media such as images and videos
- Marketplace offerings and suggestions

## Privacy First

Your privacy is paramount. All preference and behavior data is processed locally on your machine. We do not have access to this data, ensuring that your personalized experience remains yours alone.

## Tips for Navigation

- Use natural language queries to find what you’re looking for more efficiently.
- Explore recommended items on the dashboard to discover new apps and tools curated for you.
- Customize the dashboard settings to prioritize the types of content you want to see more frequently.
